Hi, I am Plamen Svetoslavov 👋

As an ADR Consultant and Ship Agent at GTA Petroleum, I apply my skills and knowledge in the transportation and trading of dangerous goods by road and the Danube River. I have over three years of experience in this industry, and I hold certifications in ADR and Ship Agency from recognized institutions.

My core competencies include classifying, packaging, labeling, and documenting hazardous materials, providing consultations and training on ADR requirements and procedures, coordinating incoming and outgoing cargo, ensuring compliance with customs and regulatory standards, and facilitating financial settlements and payments related to the activities of the ships in the port.

My mission is to provide efficient and timely fuel delivery solutions that meet the individual needs and requirements of our customers. I strive to provide personalized service and foster long-lasting partnerships based on mutual trust and success. I am passionate about learning new things and staying updated on the latest developments and trends in the fuel industry.
